# Automatic Axial Control

Welcome to Automatic Axial Control, a project dedicated to the design and implementation of a 5-axis Rubik's Cube solver. This project integrates mechanical design, computer vision, and automated control to create a fully functional robotic solution capable of solving a Rubik's Cube with minimal human input. The system includes automatic color scanning and control software with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

## üìù Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the combination of:

Mechanical Engineering: A custom-built 5-axis robotic arm designed to manipulate and rotate the Rubik's Cube accurately.
Computer Vision: Automatic color scanning and cube state recognition to determine the current state of the puzzle.
Control Software: A custom-made application with a user-friendly GUI to monitor and control the robot's actions in real time.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project is being shared as-is and may not be well-documented. It is an older project of mine, and I currently have no plans to provide additional documentation or support. Please note that some parts of the project may appear disorganized, but the system works as intended.

Feel free to explore the repository, adapt the project for your own needs, or learn from the code and design.
